# DiscordManager
The DiscordManager is a framework that allows you to create plugin-based Discord bots.

# Why using Discord Manager?
Have you ever had an incident where your code for a Discord bot, which was actually so simple, became so much bigger than you first thought? 
Do you lose the overview? 

With Discord Manager you can split your logic into small manageable parts. 
You want your bot to send a welcome message when joining a server? 
Outsource this logic to your 'WelcomePlugin'. 

This framework will become an easy addable NuGet Package.

# Documentation? 
As soon as I deploy my version 5.0 a documentation will follow. 
I'm currently rewriting this version of the framework to make it more general-purpose.
If you are interested in this framework, you can use GitHub's "watch" feature to get notified as soon as the version 5 follows. 

# API Enhancements? 
You have some ideas for any useful features? Create a pullrequest. 
As soon as I've seen your changes I most likely approve it.
